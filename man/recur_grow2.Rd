\title{Recursive Growing Function (No Lag)}
\usage{
recur_grow2(x, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. A vector where the first element represents the initial value, and the rest are placeholders that will be replaced with recursively calculated values.}

\item{g}{Numeric vector. A vector of growth rates for each period, expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5 percent growth).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. A vector of the same length as \code{x}, where the first value is unchanged, and subsequent values are recursively grown based on \code{g} without a lag.
}
\description{
This function calculates a series of values that grow recursively based on an initial value and a vector of growth rates, without incorporating a lag effect.
}
\details{
- The growth vector \code{g} is shifted to remove the lag, so \code{g[1]} represents the growth for the first step.
- The function then calls \code{\link{recur_grow}} to perform the recursive growth calculation.
}
\examples{
# Example with an initial value and growth rates
x <- numeric(5)
x[1] <- 100  # Initial value
g <- c(0.05, 0.03, 0.02, 0.04)
recur_grow2(x, g)

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{recur_grow}} for the version with lag.
