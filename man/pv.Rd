\title{Present Value of a Growing Annuity}
\usage{
pv(rate, g = 0, nper, pmt, t = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric. The interest rate per period (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate of payments per period (default is 0).}

\item{nper}{Integer. The total number of periods (e.g., 10 for 10 periods).}

\item{pmt}{Numeric. The payment amount per period.}

\item{t}{Integer. Timing of payments:
- \code{t = 1}: Payments occur at the end of the period (default).
- \code{t = 0}: Payments occur at the beginning of the period.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value of the growing annuity.
}
\description{
This function calculates the present value (PV) of a growing annuity, taking into account
the interest rate, growth rate, number of periods, payment amount, and timing of payments.
