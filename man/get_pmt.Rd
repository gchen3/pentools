\title{Calculate Payment for Growing Annuity}
\usage{
get_pmt(r, g = 0, nper, pv, t = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Numeric. The interest rate per period as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5 percent).}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate of payments per period as a decimal (default is 0).}

\item{nper}{Integer. The total number of periods for the annuity.}

\item{pv}{Numeric. The present value of the growing annuity.}

\item{t}{Integer. Timing of payments:
- \code{t = 1}: Payments occur at the end of the period (default).
- \code{t = 0}: Payments occur at the beginning of the period.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The payment amount for the growing annuity.
}
\description{
This function calculates the payment amount for a growing annuity given a present value,
interest rate, growth rate, number of periods, and payment timing.
}
\details{
This function calculates the payment by first adjusting the discount rate to account for growth,
then using the payment calculation for a standard annuity, and finally adjusting for timing.
The formula uses an effective rate of (1+r)/(1+g) - 1 and adjusts the present value by (1+r)^t.
}
\examples{
# Calculate payment for a growing annuity with 5 percent interest, 2 percent growth, 10 periods
get_pmt(r = 0.05, g = 0.02, nper = 10, pv = 10000, t = 1)

# Calculate payment for an annuity with no growth (standard annuity)
get_pmt(r = 0.05, g = 0, nper = 10, pv = 10000, t = 1)

# Calculate payment for payments at beginning of period
get_pmt(r = 0.05, g = 0.02, nper = 10, pv = 10000, t = 0)
