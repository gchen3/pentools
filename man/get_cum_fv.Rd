\title{Calculate Cumulative Future Values}
\usage{
get_cum_fv(interest, cashflow, first_value = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{interest}{Numeric. The interest rate per period as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5 percent).}

\item{cashflow}{Numeric vector. A vector of cash flow amounts for each period.}

\item{first_value}{Numeric. The initial cumulative value at the start (default is 0).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. A vector of cumulative future values, where each element represents
        the accumulated value up to that period, including compound interest.
}
\description{
This function computes the cumulative future values of a series of cash flows,
compounding at a given interest rate over time.
}
\details{
The cumulative future value is calculated iteratively:
\itemize{
  \item For the first period, the cumulative value equals \code{first_value}.
  \item For subsequent periods, the formula is:
        \code{cumvalue[i] = cumvalue[i-1] * (1 + interest) + cashflow[i-1]}
}
This represents the previous cumulative value growing with interest plus the new cash flow.
}
\examples{
# Example with annual cash flows and 5 percent interest
cashflows <- c(1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000)
get_cum_fv(interest = 0.05, cashflow = cashflows, first_value = 0)

# Example starting with an initial value
get_cum_fv(interest = 0.03, cashflow = c(500, 600, 700), first_value = 1000)

# Example with varying cash flows
varying_cf <- c(100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350)
get_cum_fv(interest = 0.04, cashflow = varying_cf, first_value = 500)
