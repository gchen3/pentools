\title{Recursive Growing Function with a Single Base and Fixed Growth Rate}
\usage{
recur_grow3(x, g, nper)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. The base value from which the growth calculation begins.}

\item{g}{Numeric. The fixed growth rate, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5% growth per period).}

\item{nper}{Integer. The total number of periods for the growth calculation, including the initial value.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. A vector of length \code{nper}, where the first element is \code{x}, and subsequent elements are calculated by applying the fixed growth rate recursively.
}
\description{
This function calculates a series of values that grow recursively starting from a single base value, using a fixed growth rate over a specified number of periods.
}
\details{
- The growth rate \code{g} is applied recursively to generate a series of growth factors.
- The initial value \code{x} is included as the first element of the resulting vector, followed by the recursively grown values.
}
\examples{
# Example with a base value and a fixed growth rate
x <- 100  # Initial value
g <- 0.05  # Growth rate (5\%)
nper <- 5  # Number of periods
recur_grow3(x, g, nper)
