\title{Calculate Present Value of a Growing Annuity Payment}
\usage{
get_pv_gpmt(rate, growth, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric. The interest rate per period as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).}

\item{growth}{Numeric. The growth rate of the payments per period as a decimal (e.g., 0.02 for 2%).}

\item{t}{Numeric. The total number of periods for the growing annuity payments.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value of the growing annuity payments.
}
\description{
This function computes the present value of a series of growing annuity payments over a specified time period, given an interest rate and growth rate.
}
\examples{
# Present value of a growing annuity with 5\% interest, 2\% growth, over 10 periods
get_pv_gpmt(rate = 0.05, growth = 0.02, t = 10)

# Present value of a growing annuity with 5\% interest, 5\% growth, over 10 periods
get_pv_gpmt(rate = 0.05, growth = 0.05, t = 10)
