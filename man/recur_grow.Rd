\title{Recursive Growing Function with Lag}
\usage{
recur_grow(x, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. A vector where the first element represents the initial value, and the rest are placeholders that will be replaced with recursively calculated values.}

\item{g}{Numeric vector. A vector of growth rates for each period, expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5 percent growth).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. A vector of the same length as \code{x}, where the first value is unchanged, and subsequent values are recursively grown based on \code{g}.
}
\description{
This function calculates a series of values that grow recursively based on an initial value and a vector of growth rates, incorporating a lag effect.
}
\details{
- The cumulative growth is calculated using \code{cumprod(1 + g)}, which computes the cumulative product of \code{1 + g}.
- Values in \code{x[2:length(x)]} are calculated as \code{x[1] * g_cul}, where \code{g_cul} is the cumulative growth factor.
- The lag effect ensures that the growth is applied recursively from the initial value.
}
\examples{
# Example with an initial value and growth rates
x <- numeric(5)
x[1] <- 100  # Initial value
g <- c(0.05, 0.03, 0.02, 0.04)
recur_grow(x, g)
