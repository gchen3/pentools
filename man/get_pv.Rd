\title{Calculate Present Value Factor}
\usage{
get_pv(rate, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric. The interest rate per period as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).}

\item{t}{Numeric. The time period for which the present value factor is calculated.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value factor, which is the discount factor (1 + rate)^(-t)
}
\description{
This function computes the present value factor for a given interest rate and time period.
}
\details{
The present value factor is used to discount future cash flows to their present value.
}
\examples{
# Calculate the present value factor for a 5\% interest rate over 3 periods
get_pv(rate = 0.05, t = 3)

# Calculate the present value factor for a 10\% interest rate over 1 period
get_pv(rate = 0.10, t = 1)
